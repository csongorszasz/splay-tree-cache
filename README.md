# Caching with Splay Trees

## Scope

Demonstrate a use case of the Splay Tree data structure on fast data retrieval, implementing a caching mechanism.

## Application

A simulated file system navigator in the terminal. Images are not actual images - only text.

Accessing an item places it at the root of the tree, making it instantly available if queried again.

Search time duration is displayed for each query.
