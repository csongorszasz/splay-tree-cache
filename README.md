# Caching with Splay Trees

## Scope

Demonstrate a use case of the Splay Tree data structure on fast data retrieval, implementing a caching mechanism.

## Application

A simulated file system navigator in the terminal.

Accessing an item places it at the root of the tree, making it instantly available if queried again.

Search time duration is displayed for each query.
